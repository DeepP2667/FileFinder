# FileFinder
This is a file finder where you can type a word or keyword. It will give a list of files containing the word. You can then open the file, which also gives where it is located.
When you type the word, it must be in all lowercase. This helps with the search. 
The file names will be dispayed as the original name, not lowercased.
